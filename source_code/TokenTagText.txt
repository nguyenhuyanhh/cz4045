<p>Tom's and Martin's response are definitely true (in just about any open source project, you'll find that most contributors are particularly interested in, well, <em>developing</em>; not so much in semi-related matters such as documentation), but I don't think your particular question at the end would fit well inside PyObjC documentation.</p>

<pre><code>NSThread.detachNewThreadSelector_toTarget_withObject_("queryController", self, None)
</code></pre>

<p><code>NSThread</code> is part of the Cocoa API, and as such <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSThread_Class/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documented over at Apple</a>, including the particular method <code>+ detachNewThreadSelector:toTarget:withObject:</code> (I'd link there, but apparently stackoverflow has bugs with parsing it). The CocoaDev wiki <a href="http://cocoadev.com/index.pl?NSThread" rel="nofollow noreferrer">also has an article</a>.</p>

<p>I don't think it would be a good idea for PyObjC to attempt to document Cocoa, other than a few basic examples of how to use it from within Python. Explaining selectors is also likely outside the scope of PyObjC, as those, too, are a feature of Objective-C, not PyObjC specifically.</p>
<p>I really like python, it's usually my language of choice these days for small (non-gui) stuff that I do on my own.</p>

<p>However, for some larger Python projects I've tackled, I'm finding that it's not quite the same as programming in say, C++. I was working on a language parser, and needed to represent an AST in Python. This is certainly within the scope of what Python can do, but I had a bit of trouble with some refactoring. I was changing the representation of my AST and changing methods and classes around a lot, and I found I missed the strong typing that would be available to me in a C++ solution. Python's duck typing was almost <em>too</em> flexible and I found myself adding a lot of <code>assert</code> code to try to check my types as the program ran. And then I couldn't really be sure that everything was properly typed unless I had 100% code coverage testing (which I didn't at the time).</p>

<p>Actually, that's another thing that I miss sometimes. It's possible to write syntactically correct code in Python that simply won't run. The compiler is incapable of telling you about it until it actually executes the code, so in infrequently-used code paths such as error handlers you can easily have unseen bugs lurking around. Even code that's as simple as printing an error message with a % format string can fail at runtime because of mismatched types.</p>

<p>I haven't used Python for any GUI stuff so I can't comment on that aspect.</p>
<p><code>B.name</code> is a class attribute, not an instance attribute.  It shows up in <code>B.__dict__</code>, but not in <code>b = B(); b.__dict__</code>.</p>

<p>The distinction is obscured somewhat because when you access an attribute on an instance, the class dict is a fallback.  So in the above example, <code>b.name</code> will give you the value of <code>B.name</code>.</p>
<p>In the following method definitions, what does the <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> do for <code>param2</code>?</p>

<pre><code>def foo(param1, *param2):
def bar(param1, **param2):
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code> is a common idiom to allow arbitrary number of arguments to functions as described in the section <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/tutorial/controlflow.html#more-on-defining-functions" rel="noreferrer">more on defining functions</a> in the Python documentation.</p>

<p>The <code>*args</code> will give you all function parameters <a href="https://docs.python.org/dev/tutorial/controlflow.html#arbitrary-argument-lists" rel="noreferrer">as a tuple</a>:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: def foo(*args):
   ...:     for a in args:
   ...:         print a
   ...:         
   ...:         

In [2]: foo(1)
1


In [4]: foo(1,2,3)
1
2
3
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>**kwargs</code> will give you all 
<strong>keyword arguments</strong> except for those corresponding to a formal parameter as a dictionary.</p>

<pre><code>In [5]: def bar(**kwargs):
   ...:     for a in kwargs:
   ...:         print a, kwargs[a]
   ...:         
   ...:         

In [6]: bar(name='one', age=27)
age 27
name one
</code></pre>

<p>Both idioms can be mixed with normal arguments to allow a set of fixed and some variable arguments:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(kind, *args, **kwargs):
   pass
</code></pre>

<p>Another usage of the <code>*l</code> idiom is to <strong>unpack argument lists</strong> when calling a function.</p>

<pre><code>In [9]: def foo(bar, lee):
   ...:     print bar, lee
   ...:     
   ...:     

In [10]: l = [1,2]

In [11]: foo(*l)
1 2
</code></pre>

<p>In Python 3 it is possible to use <code>*l</code> on the left side of an assignment (<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/" rel="noreferrer">Extended Iterable Unpacking</a>), though it gives a list instead of a tuple in this context:</p>

<pre><code>first, *rest = [1,2,3,4]
first, *l, last = [1,2,3,4]
</code></pre>

<p>Also Python 3 adds new semantic (refer <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/" rel="noreferrer">PEP 3102</a>):</p>

<pre><code>def func(arg1, arg2, arg3, *, kwarg1, kwarg2):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>Such function accepts only 3 positional arguments, and everything after <code>*</code> can only be passed as keyword arguments.</p>
<p>You will want to wire your URL to the Django <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/generic-views/#django-views-generic-create-update-create-object" rel="nofollow noreferrer">create_object generic view</a>, and pass it either "model" (the model you want to create) or "form_class" (a customized <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/topics/forms/modelforms/#topics-forms-modelforms" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ModelForm</a> class).  There are a number of <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/generic-views/#django-views-generic-create-update-create-object" rel="nofollow noreferrer">other arguments</a> you can also pass to override default behaviors.</p>

<p>Sample URLconf for the simplest case:</p>

<pre><code>from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
from django.views.generic.create_update import create_object

from my_products_app.models import Product

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^admin/products/add/$', create_object, {'model': Product}))
</code></pre>

<p>Your template will get the context variable "form", which you just need to wrap in a &lt;form> tag and add a submit button.  The simplest working template (by default should go in "my_products_app/product_form.html"):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="." method="POST"&gt;
  {{ form }}
  &lt;input type="submit" name="submit" value="add"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that your Product model must have a get_absolute_url method, or else you must pass in the post_save_redirect parameter to the view.  Otherwise it won't know where to redirect to after save.</p>
<p>You might need something more complicated than a regular expression. Web pages often have angle brackets that aren't part of a tag, like this:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;div&gt;5 &lt; 7&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Stripping the tags with regex will return the string "5 " and treat</p>

<pre><code> &lt; 7&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>as a single tag and strip it out.</p>

<p>I suggest looking for already-written code that does this for you. I did a search and found this: <a href="http://zesty.ca/python/scrape.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://zesty.ca/python/scrape.html</a> It also can resolve HTML entities.</p>
<p>There's a pattern that I learned from Twisted Python code.</p>

<pre><code>class SMTP:
    def lookupMethod(self, command):
        return getattr(self, 'do_' + command.upper(), None)
    def do_HELO(self, rest):
        return 'Howdy ' + rest
    def do_QUIT(self, rest):
        return 'Bye'

SMTP().lookupMethod('HELO')('foo.bar.com') # =&gt; 'Howdy foo.bar.com'
SMTP().lookupMethod('QUIT')('') # =&gt; 'Bye'
</code></pre>

<p>You can use it any time you need to dispatch on a token and execute extended piece of code. In a state machine you would have <code>state_</code> methods, and dispatch on <code>self.state</code>. This switch can be cleanly extended by inheriting from base class and defining your own <code>do_</code> methods. Often times you won't even have <code>do_</code> methods in the base class.</p>

<p><em>Edit: how exactly is that used</em></p>

<p>In case of SMTP you will receive <code>HELO</code> from the wire. The relevant code (from <code>twisted/mail/smtp.py</code>, modified for our case) looks like this</p>

<pre><code>class SMTP:
    # ...

    def do_UNKNOWN(self, rest):
        raise NotImplementedError, 'received unknown command'

    def state_COMMAND(self, line):
        line = line.strip()
        parts = line.split(None, 1)
        if parts:
            method = self.lookupMethod(parts[0]) or self.do_UNKNOWN
            if len(parts) == 2:
                return method(parts[1])
            else:
                return method('')
        else:
            raise SyntaxError, 'bad syntax'

SMTP().state_COMMAND('   HELO   foo.bar.com  ') # =&gt; Howdy foo.bar.com
</code></pre>

<p>You'll receive <code>'  HELO   foo.bar.com '</code> (or you might get <code>'QUIT'</code> or <code>'RCPT TO: foo'</code>). This is tokenized into <code>parts</code> as <code>['HELO', 'foo.bar.com']</code>. The actual method lookup name is taken from <code>parts[0]</code>.</p>

<p>(The original method is also called <code>state_COMMAND</code>, because it uses the same pattern to implement a state machine, i.e. <code>getattr(self, 'state_' + self.mode)</code>)</p>

<p>How do I select a(or some) random row(s) from a table using SQLAlchemy? </p>
<p>This is very much a database-specific issue.</p>

<p>I know that PostgreSQL and MySQL have the ability to order by a random function, so you can use this in SQLAlchemy:</p>

<pre><code>from  sqlalchemy.sql.expression import func, select

select.order_by(func.random()) # for PostgreSQL, SQLite

select.order_by(func.rand()) # for MySQL

select.order_by('dbms_random.value') # For Oracle
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you need to limit the query by the number of records you need (for example using <code>.limit()</code>).</p>

<p>Bear in mind that at least in PostgreSQL, selecting random record has severe perfomance issues; <a href="http://www.depesz.com/index.php/2007/09/16/my-thoughts-on-getting-random-row/" rel="noreferrer">here</a> is good article about it.</p>
<p>I am trying to get some accurate runtime comparisons of PHP vs Python (and potentially any other language that I have to include).

<p>Here is a benchmark showing that using <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html?highlight=lower#string.lower" rel="noreferrer"><code>str.lower</code></a> is faster than the accepted answer's proposed method (<code>libc.strcasecmp</code>):</p>

<pre><code>#/usr/bin/env python2.5
import random
import timeit

from ctypes import *
libc = CDLL("libc.dylib") # change to "libc.so.6" on linux

words = [word.rstrip() for word in
          open('/usr/share/dict/words', 'r').readlines()]
random.shuffle(words)
print '%i words in list' % len(words)

setup = 'from __main__ import words, libc; gc.enable()'
stmts = [
    ("simple sort", "sorted(words)"),
    ("sort with key=str.lower", "sorted(words, key=str.lower)"),
    ("sort with cmp=libc.strcasecmp", "sorted(words, cmp=libc.strcasecmp)"),
]

for (comment, stmt) in stmts:
    t = timeit.Timer(stmt=stmt, setup=setup)
    print "%s: %.2f msec/pass" % (comment, (1000*t.timeit(10)/10))
</code></pre>

<p>typical times on my machine:</p>

<pre><code>235886 words in list
simple sort: 483.59 msec/pass
sort with key=str.lower: 1064.70 msec/pass
sort with cmp=libc.strcasecmp: 5487.86 msec/pass
</code></pre>

<p>So, the version with <code>str.lower</code> is not only the fastest by far, but also the most portable and pythonic of all the proposed solutions here.
I have not profiled memory usage, but the original poster has still not given a compelling reason to worry about it. Also, who says that a call into the libc module doesn't duplicate any strings?</p>

<p>NB: The <code>lower()</code> string method also has the advantage of being locale-dependent. Something you will probably not be getting right when writing your own "optimised" solution. Even so, due to bugs and missing features in Python, this kind of comparison may give you wrong results in a unicode context.</p>
<p>In Python and Ruby it is only possible to use multiple cores, is to spawn new (heavyweight) processes.
The Java counterparts inherit the possibilities of the Java platform. You could imply use Java threads. That is for example a reason why sometimes (often) Java Application Server like Glassfish are used for Ruby on Rails applications.</p>

<p>To provide some timing figures behind the different approaches, consider the following code.
<em>The get() is my custom addition to Python's setobject.c, being just a pop() without removing the element.</em></p>

<pre><code>from timeit import *

stats = ["for i in xrange(1000): iter(s).next()   ",
         "for i in xrange(1000): \n\tfor x in s: \n\t\tbreak",
         "for i in xrange(1000): s.add(s.pop())   ",
         "for i in xrange(1000): s.get()          "]

for stat in stats:
    t = Timer(stat, setup="s=set(range(100))")
    try:
        print "Time for %s:\t %f"%(stat, t.timeit(number=1000))
    except:
        t.print_exc()
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./test_get.py
Time for for i in xrange(1000): iter(s).next()   :       0.433080
Time for for i in xrange(1000):
        for x in s:

Time for for i in xrange(1000): s.add(s.pop())   :       0.317418
Time for for i in xrange(1000): s.get()          :       0.146673

<p>This means that the <strong><em>for/break</em></strong> solution is the fastest (sometimes faster than the custom get() solution).</p>
<p>Many command line tools don't have a javascript interpreter so do not support web 2.0 functionality.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/juicedpyshell" rel="nofollow noreferrer">juicedpyshell</a> is based on PyXPCOMext's PyShell example.

  <p>I thought that f_dot would be slower since it had to create the temporary array denominator, and I assumed that this step was skipped by f_no_dot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For what it's worth, creating the temporary array <em>is</em> skipped, which is why <code>f_no_dot</code> is slower (but uses less memory).</p>

<p>Element-wise operations on arrays of the same size are faster, because numpy doesn't have to worry about the striding (dimensions, size, etc) of the arrays.</p>

<p>Operations that use broadcasting will generally be a bit slower than operations that don't have to.</p>

<p>If you have the memory to spare, creating a temporary copy can give you a speedup, but will use more memory.</p>

<p>For example, comparing these three functions:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import timeit

def f_no_dot(x, y):
    return x / y

def f_dot(x, y):
    denom = np.dot(y, np.ones((1,2)))
    return x / denom

def f_in_place(x, y):
    x /= y
    return x

num = 3600000
x = np.ones((num, 2))
y = np.ones((num, 1))


for func in ['f_dot', 'f_no_dot', 'f_in_place']:
    t = timeit.timeit('%s(x,y)' % func, number=100,
            setup='from __main__ import x,y,f_dot, f_no_dot, f_in_place')
    print func, 'time...'
    print t / 100.0
</code></pre>

<p>This yields similar timings to your results:</p>

<pre><code>f_dot time...
0.184361531734
f_no_dot time...
0.619203259945
f_in_place time...
0.585789341927
</code></pre>

<p>However, if we compare the memory usage, things become a bit clearer...</p>

<p>The combined size of our <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> arrays is about 27.5 + 55 MB, or 82 MB (for 64-bit ints).  There's an additional ~11 MB of overhead in import numpy, etc.</p>

<p>Returning <code>x / y</code> as a new array (i.e. not doing <code>x /= y</code>) will require another 55 MB array.</p>

<p><strong>100 runs of <code>f_dot</code>:</strong>
We're creating a temporary array here, so we'd expect to see 11 + 82 + 55 + 55 MB or ~203 MB of memory usage.  And, that's what we see...
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/imUja.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p><strong>100 runs of <code>f_no_dot</code>:</strong>
If no temporary array is created, we'd expect a peak memory usage of 11 + 82 + 55 MB, or 148 MB...<br>
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y3ibZ.png" alt="enter image description here">
...which is exactly what we see. </p>

<p>So, <code>x / y</code> is <em>not</em> creating an additional <code>num x 2</code> temporary array to do the division.</p>

<p>Thus, the division takes a quite a bit longer than it would if it were operating on two arrays of the same size.</p>

<p><strong>100 runs of <code>f_in_place</code>:</strong>
If we can modify <code>x</code> in-place, we can save even more memory, if that's the main concern.

<p>A simple approach would be to pass in strings as stockQty containing the name of the member you want to modify (e.g. "qtyA"), and use <code>getattr(self, stockQty)</code> to read and <code>setattr(self, stockQty, newVal)</code> to change the value of this parameter.</p>

<p>If you are not happy about passing in free form strings, you can define some class variables, e.g. <code>refQtyA = "qtyA"</code>, and use them as your parameters when you call your function: <code>buy(p.refQtyA, 10, 25)</code>.</p>
<p>You are matching it with <code>\d{3}</code> so it will match only if it is a number with three digits ( including leading zeroes)</p>
<p>I need to access the process' environment block in a platform-independent manner.</p>

<p>The python <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.html" rel="nofollow">os module docs</a> don't specify anything about case-sensitivity of the <code>os.environ</code> / <code>os.getenv</code>.  Experimenting on my ubuntu and win7 dev box's, I see that os.environ is case sensitive on linux but not on windows (This mirrors the behavior of <code>set</code> on both platforms)</p>

<p>Since dict's are obviously case-senstive for string keys, it appears that the value returned by <code>os.environ</code> is only <em>duck-typed</em> as a dict...</p>

<p>Question:
<strong>Where/How should I be able to find the definitive answer</strong> on this behavior?  I would rather have a real answer than just empirically determine it :)</p>

<p>Alternatively, is os.getenv(...) a better api to use? why?</p>

<p>How can I get <strong>currently running testcase name</strong>, while in the testsuite collection there are 16 testcases.

<p>Each <code>for</code> makes a loop; your code has two loops for years inside each other – it processes <em>all the years</em> with the first line of the file, then all the years for the second, etc. This is the error you're running into, but if you just go and fix it somehow, another one will pop up soon enough.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, please do borrow a good Python book at the library and spend some time reading and doing the exercises. Or join a course. Get a knowledgeable friend to review your code for you. StackOverflow might help you to get through a specific problem, but sadly it can't teach you the concepts. You're on the wrong path; there's nothing but trouble ahead if you just continue like this. You should go back and learn the basics a bit better, it'll make it much easier in the long run.</p>

<p>Computers are there to do tedious and repetitive tasks for you. You should <strong>never</strong> type out a giant list of numbers or numbered variables.

<p>Use descriptive names for your variables, not abbreviations. This is Python, we like things clear. And put each statement on its own line; all those semicolons look ugly. These things are important if you want to share code, get help, or just organize your own thoughts on it.</p>

<p>Study the documentation for the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">csv module</a> and use its reader also, not just the writer.</p>

<p>Here's to you becoming a good programmer one day :)</p>
<p>I'm struggling to understand how standardizing on one or another would not introduce serious violations of the principle of least astonishment.</p>

<p>On windows, programmers are used to case insensitivity... why would a windows-only programmer expect to have to picky about this? Note that there is no possible way to implement case-sensitive environment variables here, that option simply doesn't work.</p>

<p>In the linux world, ENVVAR and envvar are two different variables, you <em>cannot</em> standardize to the windows mechanism without potentially hiding information.</p>

<p>In the version that is implemented, you force the developer to specify upper or lower case for a cross-platform app. The case specification is irrelevant on windows, and you'd have to do it anyways for *nix.</p>
<p>I think the most elegant way it to invoke the W3C Validation Service at</p>

<pre><code>http://validator.w3.org/

<p>programmatically. Few people know that you do not have to screen-scrape the results in order to get the results, because the service returns non-standard HTTP header paramaters </p>

<pre><code>X-W3C-Validator-Recursion: 1
X-W3C-Validator-Status: Invalid (or Valid)
X-W3C-Validator-Errors: 6
X-W3C-Validator-Warnings: 0

<p>for indicating the validity and the number of errors and warnings.</p>

<p>For instance, the command line </p>

<pre><code>curl -I "http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stalsoft.com"

<p>Q> Why it doesn't work here now?</p>
<p>I got a program running on my local machine which uses some files. I create the reference to the files by using: <code>os.path.join( tempfile.gettempdir(), 'filename.txt' )</code></p>

<p>After that I'm running a program which accepts some parameters <code>--log-file filepath</code> where filepath is one of the files I just explained above.</p>

<p>On my machine python creates backslashes for the paths but not double backslashes and the program complains because it's considered an escape character and should be a double backslash.</p>

<p>Is there any standard way of making sure that I get a working path with double backslashes in python? I could use regex but I would prefer something similar to what <code>os.</code> provides. Maybe I'm missing something.</p>

<p>I'm calling the program using <code>subprocess.Popen</code>:</p>

<p><code>self._proc = subprocess.Popen( command.split( ' ' ) )</code></p>

<p>where <code>command</code> is something like <code>pcix.exe --log-file file_path</code></p>

<p>Also, running a test on my console shows that my python does not produce double backslash for paths:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), "test.txt")
c:\users\manilo~1\appdata\local\temp\test.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Leaving out the print command produces the same path:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), "test.txt")
c:\users\manilo~1\appdata\local\temp\test.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea why?</p>

<p>P.S. The platform i'm running is <code>CPython</code></p>
<p>You need to remove the element from its <em>parent</em>; you'll need to get a reference to the parent directly though, there is no path from child back up. In this case you'll have to get a reference to the <code>&lt;bar&gt;</code> element at the same time as finding the <code>&lt;buildCommand&gt;</code> element.</p>

<p>Trying to remove the tag from the root fails because the tag is not a direct child of the root.</p>
<p>Create an inverted index that has:</p>

<pre><code>customer1: [item1, item3, item8, ...]
customer2: [item7, item8, item74, ...]
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can:</p>

<ol>
<li>Look up an item to get the list of customers who bought it</li>
<li>Look up each customer to get the list of items that customer bought</li>
</ol>

<p>Your time per item should go from 2 minutes to less than 2 seconds.</p>

<p>It requires more memory for that second index, but you're not duplicating the data. And if memory is a problem, you can store this in a simple database and still be much faster than the N^2 algorithm that you're currently using.</p>

<h2>More detail</h2>

<p>You want to create an N*N matrix that shows the similarity between any two items. Using my technique, you do the following:</p>

<pre><code>Create an N*N matrix, and initialize it to 0.
for each item
  Get the list of customers who bought the item (from your item-to-customer index).
  Create an empty dictionary of related items
  for each customer in that list
    for each item that the customer bought
      update the dictionary (add new item, or increase count)
    end for
  end for
  You now have a dictionary that contains the related items,
  and how many customers bought each one. You can update the matrix row
  for the current item from that dictionary.

<p>I am trying to get a correct way of fitting a beta distribution. It's not a real world problem i am just testing the effects of a few different methods, and in doing this something is puzzling me.</p>

<p>Here is the python code I am working on, in which I tested 3 different approaches:
1>: fit using moments (sample mean and variance).
2>: fit by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (by using scipy.optimize.fmin()).
3>: simply call scipy.stats.beta.fit()</p>

<pre><code>from scipy.optimize import fmin
from scipy.stats import beta

<p>The problem I have is about the normalization process (<code>z=(x-a)/(b-a)</code>) where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are the min and max of the sample, respectively.</p>

<p>When I don't do the normalization, everything works Ok, there are slight differences among different fitting methods, by reasonably good.</p>

<p>But when I did the normalization, here is the result plot I got.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tw9RX.jpg" alt="Plot"></p>

<p>Only the moment method (green line) looks Ok.</p>

<p>The scipy.stats.beta.fit() method (red line) is uniform always, no matter what parameters I use to generate the random numbers.</p>

<p>And the MLE (blue line) fails.</p>

<p>So it seems like the normalization is creating these issues. But I think it is legal to have <code>x=0</code> and <code>x=1</code> in the beta distribution. And if given a real world problem, isn't it the 1st step to normalize the sample observations to make it in between [0,1] ? In that case, how should I fit the curve?</p>
<p>I'm writing a program for a dice game (Pig). In the game, the player will roll a d6 until they decide to hold their score (passing to the computer) or until they roll a 1, which will automatically make it the computer's turn.</p>

<p>The issue I'm having is that I need the function for the computer's turn to loop ten times. I want the computer to roll the die ten times, where it will either roll a one and pass back to the player or it will hold after ten rolls. How do I get the computer to roll the die ten times without using a loop inside of Tk?</p>

<p>I'm not so sure there is a faster way. As I see it, you have to first find "val2" in the list, which in my experience requires a loop.</p>
<p>If you don't want to use Classes to maintain state, then you may want to have a <code>global</code> variable or you can return the list from <code>create_list()</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Using global variable</strong>:</p>

<p>Note that using global variables is not encouraged.</p>

<p>But I don't think this will of much help to you as you probably need to keep the state of your list throughout the program.</p>
<p>I've visited the documenation at <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/templates/builtins/#std%3atemplatetag-url" rel="nofollow">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/templates/builtins/#std:templatetag-url</a> several times and i cant seem to get this syntax to work anywhere:</p>

<p>I have a view that takes one parameter so this should work but im only getting NoReverseMatch exception for some strange reason.</p>

<pre><code>{% url 'view' obj.id as test %}
&lt;a href="{{ test }}"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;

<p>..im getting the correct url returned back and the link address displays correctly, but when using the above mentioned syntax without setting is as a variable it doesnt work, when i for example use it directly in an element.</p>

<p>When trying to do this which im trying to do:</p>

<pre><code>{% url 'view' obj.id as test %}
&lt;input type="hidden" value="{{ test }}"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>im not getting any error but it doesnt seem like im getting any value in the value field because if there were a value in the field the code would do something, and when replacing the variable with a hard-coded string it does work.</p>

<p>When doing this:</p>

<pre><code>{% url 'view' obj.id as test %}
{{ test }}
</code></pre>

<p>just to try to print the value it doesnt return anything which i find strange because when using it with the a element in html as shown at the first code line above it displays the correct url.</p>

<p>So basically, im only getting the {% url 'view' obj.id %} syntax to work with the a element of html and only if i define it as a variable.</p>

<p>I would like to use the {% url 'view' obj.id %} syntax in order to have a DRY code. According to the documenation this should work, does anyone have a clue about why this isnt working ? If you need more information then please let me know and i will update the question with the necessary information.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
I'm currently using django 1.6.
The typo in the second snippet has been corrected.
The exact line from urls.py is (im at this page, using the comment system at /comment/ which should do a reverse to the display_story view (it works without problems when hardcoding the value attribute of the input html tag but not with the url function):</p>

<pre><code>url(r'^story/display/(?P&lt;specific_story&gt;\d+)/$', 'base.views.display_story', name='display_story'),
url(r'^comments/', include("django.contrib.comments.urls"))
</code></pre>

<p>I have also tried the url function just on the application i have created without going through the comments application but i get the same problem.</p>

<p>This is the error message:</p>

<pre><code>NoReverseMatch at /story/display/1/
Reverse for 'display_story' with arguments '(1,)' and keyword arguments '{}' not found.
</code></pre>

<p>Even though i know that the view exists and takes one argument.</p>

<p>This is the html code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="next" value="{% url 'display_story' story_details.id %}"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have named views with the name argument and i apply the namespace when necessary.</p>

<p>The django docs says:
exception NoReverseMatch
The NoReverseMatch exception is raised by django.core.urlresolvers when a matching URL in your URLconf cannot be identified based on the parameters supplied.</p>

<p>but that doesnt seem to be the case.</p>

<p>This urls.py:</p>

<pre><code>url(r'^story/display/(?P&lt;specific_story&gt;\d+)/$', 'base.views.display_story', name='display_story')
</code></pre>

<p>should match this view code:</p>

<pre><code>def display_story(request, specific_story):
    """ Display details for a specific story. """
    story_details = Story.objects.get(id=specific_story)

    return render(request, "base/story/display_story.html", {
                    'story_details': story_details,
        })
</code></pre>

<p>but for some reason django doesnt think the parameter sent is the the one the function receives when it clearly is stated so in the code.</p>

<p>Update 2:
When giving a keyword argument instead of a positional argument i get this error:</p>

<pre><code>NoReverseMatch at /story/display/1/
Reverse for 'display_story' with arguments '()' and keyword arguments '{u'specific_story': 1}' not found.
</code></pre>

<p>This code is used:</p>

<pre><code>{% url 'display_story' specific_story=story_details.id %}
</code></pre>

<p>Update 3:
I will update the question with the values of the local vars for the reverse function.</p>

<p>You should not use SSL to a <code>localhost</code> hostname connection. SSL + HTTPS use a certificate with your domain name, and use this to provide authentication.</p>

<p>Since you are connecting to <code>localhost</code>, your hostname (localhost) will not match the hostname on the certificate and you will receive a certificate error.</p>

<p>There are some ways to hack around this, but I would just non-SSL (regular HTTP) on your local machine, and then when you push to your server (with your proper domain name), you can enable SSL.</p>
<p>I was asking myself the same question few times. And even though the guys here tried hard to explain it, IMHO the best answer (and simplest) answer I have found is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=classmethod#classmethod" rel="nofollow">description</a> of the Class method in the Python Documentation.</p>

<p>There is also reference to the Static method. And in case someone already know instance methods (which I assume), this answer might be the final piece to put it all together...</p>

Together, they should be unique (unique_together)</p>

<p>I think you should drop the "analog=True" from your call to scipy.signal.butter and use the default digital filter. When I did this with your data, it worked pretty well.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.signal.butter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A scalar or length-2 sequence giving the critical frequencies. For a
  Butterworth filter, this is the point at which the gain drops to
  1/sqrt(2) that of the passband (the “-3 dB point”). <strong>For digital
  filters, Wn is normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 is the Nyquist
  frequency, pi radians/sample. (Wn is thus in half-cycles / sample.)
  For analog filters, Wn is an angular frequency (e.g. rad/s).</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you requested an analog filter, you shouldn't have normalized the start and stop frequencies to the nyquist rate. That's only appropriate for a digital filter.</p>

<p>Is there a reason you want to use an analog filter here? I always use digital filters.</p>

<p>I have written a program for the Bioinformatics 1 course from Coursera. The program is working all right, but is <strong>very slow for large datasets</strong>. I guess, it is because the loop is running for 4**k times, where k is the length of the sub-string that is passed into the function.

<p>However, I have a feeling you don’t <em>quite</em> understand what’s happening here (no offence). First have a look at the documentation of <code>os.walk</code> provided by @mescalinum . The third tuple element <code>files</code> will contain only the file name. You need to combine it with <code>paths</code> to get a full path to the file. </p>

<p>Also, you don’t need to read the file first to write to it. On the other hand, if you want to <em>append</em> to the file, you should use the mode 'a' when opening the file</p>

<p>Python looks for local variables in functions at compile time. There is only one scope per function. So <code>global_var2</code> is local, because it is defined as local variable in the last line of the function.</p>
<p>This code is not tested, it is likely to include syntax errors. It's just for you to get an idea of how to get started. It's also not efficient because I don't know exactly what information you want to get. I'm iteration over the excel sheet multiple times, if you really want to get the information of all customers everytime, it would be more efficient to read all customers into memory before iterating over the excel sheet.</p>

<p>First some modules we will use.</p>

<pre><code>import re
</code></pre>

<p>You already managed to read the excel file so I will start with the loop that iterates over the customers. You can use the os.listdir function to do so.</p>

<pre><code>customer_folder = "path/to/customer/folder"
for file in os.listdir(customer_folder):
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have a loop that iterates over the customer files. Let's print which customer we are looking at at the momemnt and check if the file name is of the expected format.</p>

<pre><code>    match = re.match("By_Customer_Id_([0-9]+)\.txt", file)
    if match:
        print("Looking at customer id '{0}':".format(match.group[1]))
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have to open the file, so we can make a list of all order id numbers of a customer.</p>

<pre><code>        with open(os.path.join(customer_folder, file) as customer:
            customer_idnos = [order.split(",")[0] for order in customer]
</code></pre>

<p>Let's iterate over the elements in the excel document so we can get information from them. We first create a dict where we save our informations later.</p>

<pre><code>            sites = {}
            for _, row in df.iterrows():
                if row["order_idno"] in customer_idnos:
</code></pre>

<p>If the ordner id number we are looking at is in the order id numbers of the customer we are looking at we get our information.</p>

<pre><code>                    if not row["sitename"] in sites:
                        sites[row["sitename"]] = []
                    sites[row["sitename"]].append(row["ts_placed"])
</code></pre>

<p>Let's print our informations.</p>

<pre><code>            for site, weeks in sites:
                print("    Site '{0}' visited {1} time(s):".format(
                                 site,        len(weeks)))
                for week in weeks:
                    print("        In week {0}".format(week))
</code></pre>
<p>I would do it with <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html?highlight=ordereddict#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow">OrderedDic</a>t , this way:</p>

d = OrderedDict()

<p>I wrote a decorator which you can use on any method to make it so that all of the arguments passed in, or any defaults, are assigned to the instance.</p>

<pre><code>def argumentsToAttributes(method):
    argumentNames = method.func_code.co_varnames[1:]

    # Generate a dictionary of default values:
    defaultsDict = {}
    defaults = method.func_defaults if method.func_defaults else ()
    for i, default in enumerate(defaults, start = len(argumentNames) - len(defaults)):
        defaultsDict[argumentNames[i]] = default

    def newMethod(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Use the positional arguments.
        for name, value in zip(argumentNames, args):
            setattr(self, name, value)

        # Add the key word arguments. If anything is missing, use the default.
        for name in argumentNames[len(args):]:
            setattr(self, name, kwargs.get(name, defaultsDict[name]))

        # Run whatever else the method needs to do.
        method(self, *args, **kwargs)

    return newMethod
</code></pre>

<p>A quick demonstration. Note that I use a positional argument <code>a</code>, use the default value for <code>b</code>, and a named argument <code>c</code>. I then print all 3 referencing <code>self</code>, to show that they've been properly assigned before the method is entered.</p>

<pre><code>class A(object):
    @argumentsToAttributes
    def __init__(self, a, b = 'Invisible', c = 'Hello'):
        print(self.a)
        print(self.b)
        print(self.c)

A('Why', c = 'Nothing')
</code></pre>

<p>Note that my decorator should work with any method, not just <code>__init__</code>.</p>
<p>While there are suggestions above for "doing it the python way", if one wants to really have a logic based on EOF, then I suppose using exception handling is the way to do it -- </p>

<pre><code>try:
    line = raw_input()
    ... whatever needs to be done incase of no EOF ...
except EOFError:
    ... whatever needs to be done incase of EOF ...
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo test | python -c "while True: print raw_input()"
test
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; 
EOFError: EOF when reading a line
</code></pre>

<p>Or press <kbd>Ctrl-Z</kbd> at a <code>raw_input()</code> prompt (Windows, <kbd>Ctrl-Z</kbd> Linux)</p>
<p>If you want to list part of your attributes, override <code>__dict__</code>:</p>

<p>I can suggest you to use the <a href="https://github.com/saprykin/plibsys" rel="nofollow">plibsys</a> C library. It is very simple, lightweight and cross-platform. Released under the LGPL. It provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>named system-wide shared memory regions (System V, POSIX and Windows implementations);</li>
<li>named system-wide semaphores for access synchronization (System V, POSIX and Windows implementations);</li>
<li>named system-wide shared buffer implementation based on the shared memory and semaphore;</li>
<li>sockets (TCP, UDP, SCTP) with IPv4 and IPv6 support (UNIX and Windows implementations).</li>
</ul>

<p>It is easy to use library with quite a good documentation. As it is written in C you can easily make bindings from scripting languages.</p>

<p>If you need to pass large data sets between processes (especially if speed is essential) it is better to use shared memory to pass the data itself and sockets to notify a process that the data is ready. You can make it as following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a process puts the data into a shared memory segment and sends a notification via a socket to another process; as a notification usually is very small the time overhead is minimal;</li>
<li>another process receives the notification and reads the data from the shared memory segment; after that it sends a notification that the data was read back to the first process so it can feed more data.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach can be implemented in a cross-platform fashion.</p>
<p>Life is too short, just use <code>pandas</code></p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd
df.to_csv('output.csv', sep='|')
</code></pre>

<p>By default, the delimiator is <code>','</code>, that is why it is called Commasv. But by changing the <code>sep</code> to <code>'|'</code>, you could simply achieve what you want.</p>
<p>You can use not in, like this: <code>X[i+1] not in group[j]</code></p>

<p>Secondly, your algorithm seems overly complicated. What something like this?</p>

<pre><code>A = [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,1], [2,1], [3,2], [3,3], [4,2], [4,3], [5,3], [6,3]]
point, label = A[0]
cuts = []
for npoint, nlabel in A[1:]:

<p>Consider a sum of <code>n</code> squared iid normal random variables <code>S = sum (Z^2(mu, sig^2))</code>.  According to <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/89779/sum-of-squares-of-normal-distributions">this question</a>, <code>S / sig^2</code> has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncentral_chi-squared_distribution" rel="nofollow noreferrer">noncentral chi-squared distribution</a> with degrees of freedom = <code>n</code> and non-centrality parameter = <code>n*mu^2</code>.</p>

<p>However, compare generating <code>N</code> of these variables <code>S</code> by summing squared normals with generating <code>N</code> noncentral chi-squared random variables directly using <code>scipy.ncx2</code>:</p>

<p>From the output of the timings in this program, it seems processing and grabbing the picture are each taking a fifth of a second, so you would think it should show one or 2 updates per second - however, if you raise your hand it shows in the webcam view after 5 seconds or so!</p>

<p>Is there some sort of internal cache keeping it from grabbing the latest webcam image? Could I adjust or multi-thread the webcam input process to fix the lag? This is on an Intel i5 with 16gb RAM.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong></p>

<p>According to here, it suggests the read grabs a video <em>frame by frame</em>. This would explain it grabbing the next frame and the next frame, until it finally caught up to all the frames that had been grabbed while it was processing. I wonder if there is an option to set the framerate or set it to drop frames and just click a picture of the face in the webcam <em>now</em> on read?

<p>You can take advantage of the <code>operator</code> module in Python and use a dictionary dispatch method, eg:</p>

<pre><code>import operator
from math import sqrt

operations = {
    '1': operator.add,
    '2': operator.sub,
    '3': operator.mul,
    '4': operator.truediv,
    '6': sqrt,
    '99': lambda c: c * 1.8 + 32 # convert C -&gt; F
}

for operation in iter(lambda: input('Operation: '), 'quit'):
    if operation not in operations:
        print('Sorry - not sure what {} is'.format(operation))
        continue
    args = map(int, input('Enter values: ').split())
    print('Result is', operations[operation](*args))
</code></pre>
<p>You are missing a few things in your <code>ListBoxComboPopup</code> class needed to make it work well with the <code>ComboCtrl</code>. At a minimum you are missing some event binding and handler to catch selection events from the <code>ListBox</code>, and an implementation of the <code>GetStringValue</code> method which the combo will call to get the value to be displayed.  Please see the <code>ComboCtrl</code> sample in the wxPython demo for more details and example code.</p>
<p>Have you try to use sudo and place the arch command inside task.arguments</p>

<p>Like this : </p>

<p>task.launchPath = "/usr/bin/sudo"
    task.arguments = ["arch", "-x86_64", "/usr/bin/python", "/Users/tomas/Developement/N_news_reader/NReader1/ahoj.py"]</p>

<p>It works for me as long as I change the visudo settings to avoid the "enter your password" step.</p>
<p>I don't see this answer here, so I figure I'll add it since I'm leaning Python right now and just discovered it. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python tutorial</a> (Python 2 in this case) gives the following simple and effective example:</p>

<pre><code>class Employee:
    pass

john = Employee()  # Create an empty employee record

# Fill the fields of the record
john.name = 'John Doe'
john.dept = 'computer lab'
john.salary = 1000
</code></pre>

<p>That is, an empty class object is created, then instantiated, and the fields are added dynamically.</p>

<p>The up-side to this is its really simple. The downside is it isn't particularly self-documenting (the intended members aren't listed anywhere in the class "definition"), and unset fields can cause problems when accessed. Those two problems can be solved by:</p>

<pre><code>class Employee:
    def __init__ (self):
        self.name = None # or whatever
        self.dept = None
        self.salary = None
</code></pre>

<p>Now at a glance you can at least see what fields the program will be expecting.</p>

<p>Both are prone to typos, <code>john.slarly = 1000</code> will succeed. Still, it works.</p>
<pre><code>value = 0x7fffffff
</code></pre>

<p>Set the value using the code above</p>
