13058101,2,7781792.0,"<p>Selenium 2's Python bindings have a new support class called expected_conditions.py for doing all sorts of things like testing if an element is visible. It's <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/support/expected_conditions.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">available here.</a></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> the above file is in the trunk as of Oct 12, 2012, but not yet in the latest download which is still 2.25. For the time being until a new Selenium version is released, you can just save this file locally for now and include it in your imports like I've done below.</p>

<p>To make life a little simpler, you can combine some of these expected condition methods with the Selenium <code>wait until</code> logic to make some very handy functions similar to what was available in Selenium 1. For example, I put this into my base class called SeleniumTest which all of my Selenium test classes extend:</p>

<pre><code>from selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutException
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions as EC
import selenium.webdriver.support.ui as ui

@classmethod
def setUpClass(cls):
    cls.selenium = WebDriver()
    super(SeleniumTest, cls).setUpClass()

@classmethod
def tearDownClass(cls):
    cls.selenium.quit()
    super(SeleniumTest, cls).tearDownClass()

# return True if element is visible within 2 seconds, otherwise False
def is_visible(self, locator, timeout=2):
    try:
        ui.WebDriverWait(driver, timeout).until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, locator)))
        return True
    except TimeoutException:
        return False

# return True if element is not visible within 2 seconds, otherwise False
def is_not_visible(self, locator, timeout=2):
    try:
        ui.WebDriverWait(driver, timeout).until_not(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, locator)))
        return True
    except TimeoutException:
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>You can then use these easily in your tests like so:</p>

<pre><code>def test_search_no_city_entered_then_city_selected(self):
    sel = self.selenium
    sel.get('%s%s' % (self.live_server_url, '/'))
    self.is_not_visible('#search-error')

<p>UPDATE:
I'm currently using django 1.6.
The typo in the second snippet has been corrected.
The exact line from urls.py is (im at this page, using the comment system at /comment/ which should do a reverse to the display_story view (it works without problems when hardcoding the value attribute of the input html tag but not with the url function):</p>

<pre><code>url(r'^story/display/(?P&lt;specific_story&gt;\d+)/$', 'base.views.display_story', name='display_story'),
url(r'^comments/', include(""django.contrib.comments.urls""))
</code></pre>

<p>I have also tried the url function just on the application i have created without going through the comments application but i get the same problem.</p>

<p>This is the error message:</p>

<pre><code>NoReverseMatch at /story/display/1/
Reverse for 'display_story' with arguments '(1,)' and keyword arguments '{}' not found.
</code></pre>

<p>Even though i know that the view exists and takes one argument.</p>

<p>This is the html code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""next"" value=""{% url 'display_story' story_details.id %}""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have named views with the name argument and i apply the namespace when necessary.</p>

<p>The django docs says:
exception NoReverseMatch
The NoReverseMatch exception is raised by django.core.urlresolvers when a matching URL in your URLconf cannot be identified based on the parameters supplied.</p>

<p>but that doesnt seem to be the case.</p>

<p>This urls.py:</p>

<pre><code>url(r'^story/display/(?P&lt;specific_story&gt;\d+)/$', 'base.views.display_story', name='display_story')
</code></pre>

<p>should match this view code:</p>

<pre><code>def display_story(request, specific_story):
    """""" Display details for a specific story. """"""
    story_details = Story.objects.get(id=specific_story)

    return render(request, ""base/story/display_story.html"", {
                    'story_details': story_details,
        })
</code></pre>

<p>but for some reason django doesnt think the parameter sent is the the one the function receives when it clearly is stated so in the code.</p>

<p>Update 2:
When giving a keyword argument instead of a positional argument i get this error:</p>

<pre><code>NoReverseMatch at /story/display/1/
Reverse for 'display_story' with arguments '()' and keyword arguments '{u'specific_story': 1}' not found.
</code></pre>

<p>This code is used:</p>

<pre><code>{% url 'display_story' specific_story=story_details.id %}
</code></pre>

<p>Update 3:
I will update the question with the values of the local vars for the reverse function.</p>

<li><p>In general, a ""whitelist"" approach is considered safer and easier than removing specific dangerous characters. That is, instead of deleting <code>%</code> and <code>_</code> from your string (and any ""lesser-known wildcards"", as you say), scan your string and keep only the characters you want. E.g., if your ""nicknames"" can contain ASCII letters, digits, ""-"" and ""."", it can be sanitized like this:</p>

<li><p>If you don't want the user to be able to supply a wildcard, why would you use <code>LIKE</code> in your query anyway?
