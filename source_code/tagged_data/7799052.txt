 I'm struggling to understand how standardizing on one or another would not introduce serious violations of the principle of least astonishment. 

 On windows, programmers are used to case insensitivity... why would a windows-only programmer expect to have to picky about this? Note that there is no possible way to implement case-sensitive environment variables here, that option simply doesn't work. 

 In the linux world, ENVVAR and envvar are two different variables, you  cannot  standardize to the windows mechanism without potentially hiding information. 

 In the version that is implemented, you force the developer to specify upper or lower case for a cross-platform app. The case specification is irrelevant on windows, and you'd have to do it anyways for *nix.
