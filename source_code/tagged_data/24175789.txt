 You should not use SSL to a <code>localhost</code> hostname connection. SSL + HTTPS use a certificate with your domain name, and use this to provide authentication. 

 Since you are connecting to <code>localhost</code>, your hostname (localhost) will not match the hostname on the certificate and you will receive a certificate error. 

 There are some ways to hack around this, but I would just non-SSL (regular HTTP) on your local machine, and then when you push to your server (with your proper domain name), you can enable SSL.
