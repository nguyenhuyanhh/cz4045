 Class methods provide a "semantic sugar" (don't know if this term is widely used) - or "semantic convenience". 

 Example: you got a set of classes representing objects. You might want to have the class method <code>all()</code> or <code>find()</code> to write <code>User.all()</code> or <code>User.find(firstname='Guido')</code>. That could be done using module level functions of course...
