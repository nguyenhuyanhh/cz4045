 Thanks to Brian's comment, I solved my issue.
My call was rejected directly by Apache when the slash was encoded. 

 I've added  AllowEncodedSlashes  Directive in my apache conf: 

 <code>AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode
</code> 

 With the key encoded with : 

 <code>encodeURIComponent(key)
</code> 

 It works.
