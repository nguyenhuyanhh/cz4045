 <code>B.name</code> is a class attribute, not an instance attribute.  It shows up in <code>B.__dict__</code>, but not in <code>b = B(); b.__dict__</code>. 

 The distinction is obscured somewhat because when you access an attribute on an instance, the class dict is a fallback.  So in the above example, <code>b.name</code> will give you the value of <code>B.name</code>.
