 You need to remove the element from its  parent ; you'll need to get a reference to the parent directly though, there is no path from child back up. In this case you'll have to get a reference to the <code>&lt;bar&gt;</code> element at the same time as finding the <code>&lt;buildCommand&gt;</code> element. 

 Trying to remove the tag from the root fails because the tag is not a direct child of the root.
