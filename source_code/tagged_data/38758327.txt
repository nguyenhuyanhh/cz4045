 Life is too short, just use <code>pandas</code> 

 <code>import pandas as pd
df.to_csv('output.csv', sep='|')
</code> 

 By default, the delimiator is <code>','</code>, that is why it is called Commasv. But by changing the <code>sep</code> to <code>'|'</code>, you could simply achieve what you want.
