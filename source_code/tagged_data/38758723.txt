 I have looked for <code>django</code> doc in their official site but i can't find the article about the <code>on_update</code> model function here in  Related objects reference  except for <code>on_delete</code>. 

 Here is an example code: 

 <code>from django.db import models

class Reporter(models.Model):
    # ...
    pass

class Article(models.Model):
    reporter = models.ForeignKey(Reporter, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
</code> 

 Is there any version of <code>on_update</code>? 

 I have visited this  Cascade on update and delete wih django  but there is not a clear answer about the <code>on_update</code>  

 I am using <code>mysql</code> and define the relationship in the <code>ERD</code> and sync it to the db and tried running the <code>python manage.py inspectdb</code> to generate the <code>django-model</code> but it shows only <code>models.DO_NOTHING</code>. 

 Is there a better way to achieve this, if any?
