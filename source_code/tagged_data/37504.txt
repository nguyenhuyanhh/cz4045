 You might need something more complicated than a regular expression. Web pages often have angle brackets that aren't part of a tag, like this: 

 <code> &lt;div&gt;5 &lt; 7&lt;/div&gt;
</code> 

 Stripping the tags with regex will return the string "5 " and treat 

 <code> &lt; 7&lt;/div&gt;
</code> 

 as a single tag and strip it out. 

 I suggest looking for already-written code that does this for you. I did a search and found this:  http://zesty.ca/python/scrape.html  It also can resolve HTML entities.
