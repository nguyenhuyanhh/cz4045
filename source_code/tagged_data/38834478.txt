 You are missing a few things in your <code>ListBoxComboPopup</code> class needed to make it work well with the <code>ComboCtrl</code>. At a minimum you are missing some event binding and handler to catch selection events from the <code>ListBox</code>, and an implementation of the <code>GetStringValue</code> method which the combo will call to get the value to be displayed.  Please see the <code>ComboCtrl</code> sample in the wxPython demo for more details and example code.
