 You can use not in, like this: <code>X[i+1] not in group[j]</code> 

 Secondly, your algorithm seems overly complicated. What something like this? 

 <code>A = [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,1], [2,1], [3,2], [3,3], [4,2], [4,3], [5,3], [6,3]]
point, label = A[0]
cuts = []
for npoint, nlabel in A[1:]:
  if not npoint == point:
     if not label == nlabel:
       cuts.append((point+npoint)/2.)
  point = npoint
  label = nlabel
</code>
