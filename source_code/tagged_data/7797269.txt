 I need to access the process' environment block in a platform-independent manner. 

 The python  os module docs  don't specify anything about case-sensitivity of the <code>os.environ</code> / <code>os.getenv</code>.  Experimenting on my ubuntu and win7 dev box's, I see that os.environ is case sensitive on linux but not on windows (This mirrors the behavior of <code>set</code> on both platforms) 

 Since dict's are obviously case-senstive for string keys, it appears that the value returned by <code>os.environ</code> is only  duck-typed  as a dict... 

 Question:
 Where/How should I be able to find the definitive answer  on this behavior?  I would rather have a real answer than just empirically determine it :) 

 Alternatively, is os.getenv(...) a better api to use? why? 

 Thanks!
